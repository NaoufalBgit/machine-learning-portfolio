# Machine Learning & Data Science Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks exploring different machine learning and data science concepts.  
Each project is organized into a dedicated folder and includes clear explanations, experiments, evaluations, and visualizations.

The objective of this portfolio is to demonstrate practical understanding of:
- supervised learning  
- model evaluation  
- cross-validation  
- error analysis  
- algorithm comparison  
- prediction combination  
- data preparation and visualization  

All notebooks can be executed using Google Colab or a local Python environment.

## 📁 Project Structure

### 🔢 Handwritten Digit Recognition (MNIST)
**Folder:** `Handwritten_Digit_Recognition/`  
A complete machine learning pipeline applied to the MNIST dataset (70,000 handwritten digits).  
It includes:

- KNN classification with stratified cross-validation  
- Logistic Regression (OvA + OvO)  
- Conflict-resolution logic between multiple classifiers  
- Confusion-matrix analysis and misclassified image visualization  
- Model combination with decision trees and logistic regression  
- Optional data augmentation experiments  

Notebooks:
- `KNN_MNIST_Classification.ipynb`  
- `LogisticRegression_MNIST_OvA_OvO.ipynb`

## 🎯 Goals of This Portfolio

- Practice end-to-end machine learning pipelines  
- Compare different algorithms on the same dataset  
- Develop intuition about model performance and error patterns  
- Build a clear and well-documented set of ML projects  

More notebooks will be added progressively to cover additional techniques (SVM, clustering, PCA, neural networks, etc.).
